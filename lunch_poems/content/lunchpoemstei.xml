            <l>It's like a locomotive on the march, the season</l>
            <l>of distress and clarity</l>
            <l>and my door is open to the evenings of midwinter's</l>
            <l>lightly falling snow over the newspapers.</l>

            <l>But no more fountains and no more rain,</l>

                  which was friendly and immediately gained for herself the appellation "the Detroit

                  she pondered the inscrutable meagerness of divine Providence, always humming,
                  always shifting a little, never missing a beat. She guested one season at the

            <l>nobody saw me because of the falls the gates the sluice the tourist boats</l>
            <l>the children were trailing their fingers in the water</l>
            <l>and the swans, regal and smarty, were nipping their "little" fingers</l>
            <l>I heard one swan remark "That was a good nip</l>

            <l>reply "Nor as tasty as those peasants we got away from the elephant that time"</l>

            <l>I wanted to be alone</l>
            <l>which is why I went to the mill in the first place</l>
            <l>now I am alone and hate it</l>

            <l>because of the gunk</l>
            <l>and the dog is always rolling over, I like dogs on their "little" feet</l>
            <l>I think I may scamper off to Winnipeg to see Raymond</l>

            <l>I see the cobwebs collecting already</l>
