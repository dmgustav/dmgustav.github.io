            <l>of distress and clarity</l>
            <l>and my door is open to the evenings of midwinter's</l>
            <l>lightly falling snow over the newspapers.</l>

            <l>But no more fountains and no more rain,</l>

                  which was friendly and immediately gained for herself the appellation "the Detroit

                  she pondered the inscrutable meagerness of divine Providence, always humming,
                  always shifting a little, never missing a beat. She guested one season at the
