                    <l>there one never did anything</l>

                <lg>
                    <l>in Boston you were never really standing</l>
                    <l>I was usually lying</l>
                    <l>it was amusing to be lying all</l>

                    <l>it means you've been to bed with a Nigra</l>
                    <l>well it is exercise</l>
                    <l>the only difference is it's better than Boston</l>

                    <l>I was walking along the street</l>

                <lg>
                    <l>then in Waukegan I met a furniture manufacturer</l>
                    <l>and it wiped out all dreams of pleasantness from my mind</l>
                    <l>it was like being pushed down hard</l>

                    <l>and in Singapore I got a dreadful</l>

                    <l>except they went into my veins</l>
                    <l>and rose to the surface like Vesuvius</l>
                    <l>getting cured was like learning to smoke</l>

                <lg>
                    <l>yet I always loved Baltimore</l>
