<p>Frank O’Hara (1926-1966) was a central figure in the New York School of poetry, a movement closely aligned socially and aesthetically with the New York School of painters. O’Hara was friends with many important poets of the time, including John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Amiri Baraka, and Allen Ginsberg. In addition, O’Hara was deeply connected to the New York art world. In 1951 he took a job at the Museum of Modern Art, where he worked in various capacities until his death in 1966. There he formed friendships with Jackson Pollock,  Willem de Kooning, Grace Hartigan and many others. These friends and their Urban Surroundings featured heavily in O’Hara’s poems.

<p>The rich interplay of people and place in O’Hara’s poems would benefit from the deep encoding allowed by TEI. O’Hara’s friends are often referred to by nicknames or pseudonyms, creating an intimate familiar world which can be difficult for those without knowledge of the 50’s-60’s New York Art scene to decipher. Linking the people and places in O’Hara’s poems to an authoritative record (Library of Congress) would be useful for both casual readers and literary scholars. O’Hara’s most influential book of poetry is Lunch Poems (1964), a volume of 37 poems written between 1953 and 1964. For my final project, I plan to create a scholarly edition of Lunch Poems encoded with TEI.

<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/lunchpoems00oharrich">Internet Archive </a> currently hosts Lunch Poems a both an EPUB and a PDF Scan of the physical book (in addition to several other formats). The PDF is important because the EPUB appears to have several mistakes throughout. My plan is to use XSLT to transform the EPUB into a TEI document, check the resulting document against the PDF scan to correct errors, and then encode the people, places, and dates contained within the poem. My project’s final step will be to publish the resulting document on Github using TEI Boilerplate.

The wireframe highlights navigation from the table of contents to individual poems (in this case the poem "A Step Away From Them") as well as one possible method for adding contextual information to enrich the poem. I'd welcome any suggestions on this, especially on ways to most effectively provide contextual information on the poems without distracting from the poems themselves. </p>
