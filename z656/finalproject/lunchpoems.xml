      <p> MUSIC</p>
      <p> If I rest for a moment near The Equestrian pausing for a liver sausage sandwich in the Mayflower Shoppe, that angel seems to be leading the horse into Bergdorf's and I am naked as a table cloth, my nerves humming. Close to the fear of war and the stars which have disappeared. I have in my hands only 35c, it's so meaningless to eat! and gusts of water spray over the basins of leaves like the hammers of a glass pianoforte. If I seem to you to have lavender lips under the leaves of the world,</p>
      <p> I must tighten my belt. It's like a locomotive on the march, the season</p>
      <p> of distress and clarity and my door is open to the evenings of midwinter's lightly falling snow over the newspapers. Clasp me in your handkerchief like a tear, trumpet of early afternoon ! in the foggy autumn. As they're putting up the Christmas trees on Park Avenue I shall see my daydreams walking by with dogs in blankets, put to some use before all those coloured lights come on !</p>
      <p> But no more fountains and no more rain,</p>
      <p> and the stores stay open terribly late.</p>

      <p> ALMA</p>
      <p> "Est-elle almee? . . . aux premieres heures bleues Se detruira-t-elle comme les fleurs feues.  . . /'</p>
      <p> â€” Rimbaud.</p>
      <p> 1</p>
      <p> The sun, perhaps three of them, one black one red, you know, and her dancing all the time, fanning the purple sky getting purple, her fancy white skin quite unoriental to the dirty children's round eyes standing in circles munching muffins, the cockroaches like nuggets half hid in the bran. Boy! how are you, Prester John ? the smile of the river, so searching, so enamelled.</p>
      <p> 2</p>
      <p> What mention of the King ? the spinning wheel still turns, the apples rot to the singing. Ale est e  on winter sojourns</p>
      <p> is nice at Nice. Wander, my dear sacred Pontiff, do dare to murder minutely and ponder what is the bloody affair</p>
      <p> inside the heart of the weak dancer, whose one toe is worth inestimable, the gang, the cheek of it! it's too dear, her birth</p>
      <p> amidst the acorns with nails stuck through them by passionate</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-9"/>
      <p> parents, castanets ! Caucasian tales ! their prodigality proportionate :</p>
      <p> "Sacred Heart, oh Heart so sick, make Detroit more wholly thine, all with greeds and scabs so thick that Judas Priest must make a sign."</p>
      <p> Thus he to bed and we to rise</p>
      <p> and Alma singing like a loon.</p>
      <p> Her dancing toenails in her eyes.</p>
      <p> Her pa was dead on the River Gaboon.</p>
      <p> 3</p>
      <p> Detroit  was founded on the great near waterways next to Canada which was friendly and immediately gained for herself the appellation "the Detroit of Thermopylaes", a name which has stuck to this day wherever ballroom dancing is held in proper esteem. Let me remind you of that great wrist movement, the enjambement schizophrene, a particularly satisfying variation of which may be made by adding a little tomato paste. Great success. While in Detroit accused of starting the Chicago fire. Millions of roses from Russians. Alma had come a long way, she opened a jewelry shop, her name became a household word, she'd invented an arch-supporter.</p>
      <p> How often she thought of her father! the castle, the kitchen-garden, the hollihocks and the mill stream beyond curving gently as a parenthesis. Many a bitter tear was shed by her on the boards of this theatre as she pondered the inscrutable meagerness of divine Providence, always humming, always shifting a little, never missing a beat. She guested one season at the height of her nostalgia with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in  Salammbo;  her</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-10"/>
      <p> father seemed very close in all that oriental splendor of bamboo and hotel palms and stale sweat and bracelets, an engagement of tears. In the snow, in her white fox fur wraps, how more beautiful than Mary Garden!</p>
      <p> 4</p>
      <p> Onward to the West. *'Where I came from, where I'm going. Indian country." Gold. Oh say can you see Alma. The darling of Them. All her friends were artists. They alone have memories. They alone love flowers. They alone give parties and die. Poor Alma. They alone.</p>
      <p> She died, and it was as if all the jewels in the world had heaved a sigh. The seismograph at Fordham University registered, for once, a spiritual note. How like a sliver in her own short fat muscular foot. She loved the Western World, though there are some who say she isn't really dead.</p>

      <p> n ON RACHMANINOFFS BIRTHDAY</p>
      <p> Quick ! a last poem before I go</p>
      <p> off my rocker. Oh Rachmaninoff!</p>
      <p> Onset, Massachusetts. Is it the fig-newton</p>
      <p> playing the horn ? Thundering windows</p>
      <p> of hell, will your tubes ever break</p>
      <p> into powder ? Oh my palace of oranges,</p>
      <p> junk shop, staples, umber, basalt;</p>
      <p> I'm a child again when I was really</p>
      <p> miserable, a grope pizzicato. My pocket</p>
      <p> of rhinestone, yoyo, carpenter's pencil,</p>
      <p> amethyst, hypo, campaign button,</p>
      <p> is the room full of smoke ? Shit</p>
      <p> on the soup, let it burn. So it's back.</p>
      <p> You'll never be mentally sober.</p>

      <p> POEM</p>
      <p> I watched an armory combing its bronze bricks and in the sky there were glistening rails of milk. Where had the swan gone, the one with the lame back ?</p>
      <p> Now mounting the steps I enter my new home full of grey radiators and glass ashtrays full of wool.</p>
      <p> Against the winter I must get a samovar embroidered with basil leaves and Ukranian mottos to the distant sound of wings, painfully anti-wind,</p>
      <p> a little bit of the blue summer air will come back as the steam chuckles in the monster's steamy attack</p>
      <p> and I'll be happy here and happy there, full of tea and tears. I don't suppose I'll ever get to Italy, but I have the terrible tundra at least.</p>
      <p> My new home will be full of wood, roots and the like, while I pace in a turtleneck sweater, repairing my bike.</p>
      <p> I watched the palisades shivering in the snow</p>
      <p> of my face, which had grown preternaturally pure.</p>
      <p> Once I destroyed a man's idea of himself to have him.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-13"/>
      <p> If I'd had a samovar then I'd have made him tea and as hyacinths grow from a pot he would love me</p>
      <p> and my charming room of tea cosies full of dirt which is why I must travel, to collect the leaves. O my enormous piano, you are not like being outdoors</p>
      <p> though it is cold and you are made of fire and wood ! I lift your lid and mountains return, that I am good.</p>
      <p> The stars blink like a hairnet that was dropped on a seat and now it is lying in the alley behind the theater where my play is echoed by dying voices.</p>
      <p> I am really a woodcarver and my words are love which willfully parades in its room, refusing to move.</p>

      <p> ON THE WAY TO SAN REMO</p>
      <p> The black ghinkos snarl their way up</p>
      <p> the moon growls at each bhnking window</p>
      <p> the apartment houses climb deafeningly into the purple</p>
      <p> A bat hisses northwards</p>
      <p> the perilous steps lead to a grate</p>
      <p> suddenly the heat is bearable</p>
      <p> The cross-eyed dog scratches a worn patch of pavement</p>
      <p> his right front leg is maimed in the shape of a V</p>
      <p> there's no trace of his nails on the street a woman cajoles</p>
      <p> She is very old and dirty she whistles her filthy hope that it will rain tonight</p>
      <p> Tlie 6th Avenue bus trunk-lumbers sideways it is full of fat people who cough as at a movie they eat each other's dandruff in the flickering glare</p>
      <p> The moon passes into clouds so hurt by the street lights of your glance oh my heart</p>
      <p> The act of love is also passing like a subway bison through the paper-littered arches of the express tracks the sailor sobers he feeds pennies to the peanut machines</p>
      <p> Though others are in the night far away lips upon a dusty armpit the nostrils are full of tears</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-15"/>
      <p> High fidelity reposed in a box a hand on the windowpane the sweet calm the violin strings tie a young man's hair the bright black eyes pin far away their smudged curiosity</p>
      <p> Yes you are foolish smoking the bars are for rabbits who wish to outlive the men</p>

      <p> 2 POEMS FROM THE OHARA MONOGATARI</p>

      <p> My love is coming in a glass the  blood of the Bourbons</p>
      <p> saxophone or cornet qu'importe ou?</p>
      <p> green of glass flowers dans le Kentucky</p>
      <p> and always the same handkerchief at the same nose of damask</p>

      <p> the Baudelaire of Kyoto's never-ending pureness is he cracked in the head ?</p>
      <p> 2</p>
      <p> After a long trip to a shrine in wooden clogs so hard on the muscles the tea is bitter and the breasts are hard so much terrace for one evening</p>
      <p> there is no longer no ocean</p>
      <p> I don't see the ocean under niy stilts</p>
      <p> as  I poke along</p>

      <p> hands on ankles feet on wrists</p>

      <p> by the pleasures of rolling in a bog</p>

      <p> A STEP AWAY FROM THEM</p>
      <p> It's my lunch hour, so I go</p>
      <p> for a walk among the hum-colored</p>
      <p> cabs. First, down the sidewalk</p>
      <p> where laborers feed their dirty</p>
      <p> glistening torsos sandwiches</p>
      <p> and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets</p>
      <p> on. They protect them from falling</p>
      <p> bricks, I guess. Then onto the</p>
      <p> avenue where skirts are flipping</p>
      <p> above heels and blow up over</p>
      <p> grates. The sun is hot, but the</p>
      <p> cabs stir up the air. I look</p>
      <p> at bargains in wristwatches. There</p>
      <p> are cats playing in sawdust.</p>
      <p> On to Times Square, where the sign blows smoke over my head, and higher the waterfall pours lightly. A Negro stands in a doorway with a toothpick, languorously agitating. A blonde chorus girl clicks : he smiles and rubs his chin. Everything suddenly honks : it is 12 :40 of a Thursday.</p>
      <p> Neon in daylight is a great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would write, as are light bulbs in daylight. I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET'S CORNER. Giulietta Masina, wife of Federico Fellini,  e bell' attrice.</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-19"/>
      <p> And chocolate malted. A lady in foxes on such a day puts her poodle in a cab.</p>
      <p> There are several Puerto Ricans on the avenue today, which makes it beautiful and warm. First Bunny died, then John Latouche, then Jackson Pollock. But is the earth as full as life was full, of them? And one has eaten and one walks, past the magazines with nudes and the posters for BULLFIGHT and the Manhattan Storage Warehouse, which they'll soon tear down. I used to think they had the Armory Show there.</p>
      <p> A glass of papaya juice and back to work. My heart is in my pocket, it is Poems by Pierre Reverdy.</p>

      <p> CAMBRIDGE</p>
      <p> It is still raining and the yellow-green cotton fruit</p>
      <p> looks silly round a window giving out on winter trees</p>
      <p> with only three drab leaves left. The hot plate works,</p>
      <p> it is the sole heat on earth, and instant coffee. I</p>
      <p> put on my warm corduroy pants, a heavy maroon sweater,</p>
      <p> and wrap myself in my old maroon bathrobe. Just like Pasternak</p>
      <p> in Marburg (they say Italy and France are colder, but</p>
      <p> I'm sure that Germany's at least as cold as this) and,</p>
      <p> lacking the Master's inspiration, I may freeze to death</p>
      <p> before I can get out into the white rain. I could have left</p>
      <p> the window closed last night ? But that's where health</p>
      <p> comes from ! His breath from the Urals, drawing me into flame</p>
      <p> like a forgotten cigarette. Burn ! this is not negligible,</p>
      <p> being poetic, and not feeble, since it's sponsored by</p>
      <p> the greatest living Russian poet at incalculable cost.</p>
      <p> Across the street there is a house under construction,</p>
      <p> abandoned to the rain. Secretly, I shall go to work on it.</p>
      <p> 1956</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-21"/>
      <p> 21 POEM</p>
      <p> Instant coffee with slightly sour cream</p>
      <p> in it, and a phone call to the beyond</p>
      <p> which doesn't seem to be coming any nearer.</p>
      <p> " Ah daddy, I wanna stay drunk many days "</p>
      <p> on the poetry of a new friend</p>
      <p> my life held precariously in the seeing</p>
      <p> hands of others, their and my impossibilities.</p>

      <p> has finally died, where there were no impossibilities ?</p>

      <p> THREE AIRS</p>
      <p> to Norman Bluhm 1.</p>
      <p> So many things in the air ! soot, elephant balls, a Chinese cloud which is entirely collapsed, a cat swung by its tail</p>
      <p> and the senses of the dead which are banging about inside my tired red eyes</p>
      <p> 2.</p>
      <p> In the deeps there is a little bird and it only hums, it hums of fortitude</p>
      <p> and temperance, it is managing a foundry</p>
      <p> how firmly it must grasp things ! tear them out of the slime and then, alas ! it mischievously</p>
      <p> drops them into the cauldron of hideousness</p>
      <p> there is already a sunset naming</p>
      <p> the poplars which see only, watery, themselves</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-23"/>
      <p> 3.</p>
      <p> Oh to be an angel (if there were any!), and go</p>
      <p> straight up into the sky and look around and then come down</p>
      <p> not to be covered with steel and aluminum glaringly ugly in the pure distances and clattering and</p>
      <p> buckling, wheezing</p>
      <p> but to be part of the treetops and the blueness, invisible, the iridescent darknesses beyond,</p>
      <p> silent, listening to the air becoming no air becoming air again</p>

      <p> this country has everything but  politesse,  a Puerto Rican cab driver says and five different girls I see</p>
      <p> look like Piedie Gimbel v^ith her blonde hair tossing too,</p>
      <p> as she looked w^hen I pushed her little daughter on the swing on the lawn it was also windy</p>

      <p> Ah Jean Dubuffet</p>

      <p> PERSONAL POEM</p>
      <p> Now when I walk around at lunchtime I have only two charms in my pocket an old Roman coin Mike Kanemitsu gave me and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case when I was in Madrid the others never brought me too much luck though they did help keep me in New York against coercion but now I'm happy for a time and interested</p>
      <p> I walk through the luminous humidity passing the House of Seagram with its wet and its loungers and the construction to the left that closed the sidewalk if I ever get to be a construction worker I'd like to have a silver hat please and get to Moriarty's where I wait for LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and shaker the last five years my batting average is .016 that's that, and LeRoi comes in and tells me Miles Davis was clubbed 12 times last night outside BIRDLAND by a cop a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible disease but we don't give her one we don't like terrible diseases, then</p>

      <p> Henry James so much we like Herman Melville</p>
      <p> we don't want to be in the poets' walk in</p>
      <p> San Francisco even we just want to be rich</p>
      <p> and walk on girders in our silver hats</p>
      <p> I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is</p>
      <p> thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi</p>
      <p> and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go</p>

      <p> ADIEU TO NORMAN, BON JOUR TO JOAN AND JEAN-PAUL</p>
      <p> It is 12 : 10 in New York and I am wondering</p>
      <p> if I will finish this in time to meet Norman for lunch</p>
      <p> ah lunch ! I think I am going crazy</p>
      <p> what with my terrible hangover and the weekend coming up</p>
      <p> at excitement-prone Kenneth Koch's</p>
      <p> I wish I were staying in town and working on my poems</p>
      <p> at Joan's studio for a new book by Grove Press</p>
      <p> which they will probably not print</p>
      <p> but it is good to be several floors up in the dead of night</p>
      <p> wondering whether you are any good or not</p>
      <p> and the only decision you can make is that you did it</p>
      <p> yesterday I looked up the rue Fremicourt on a map</p>
      <p> and was happy to find it like a bird</p>
      <p> flying over Paris et ses environs</p>
      <p> which unfortunately did not include Seine-et-Oise</p>
      <p> which I don't know as well as a number of other things and Allen is back talking about god a lot and Peter is back not talking very much and Joe has a cold and is not coming to Kenneth's although he is coming to lunch with Norman I suspect he is making a distinction well, who isn't</p>
      <p> I wish I were reeling around Paris</p>
      <p> instead of reeling around New York</p>
      <p> I wish I weren't reeling at all</p>
      <p> it is Spring the ice has melted the Ricard is being poured</p>

      <p> is that simple</p>
      <p> yes, it is simple because it is the only thing to do</p>
      <p> can you do it</p>
      <p> yes, you can because it is the only thing to do</p>
      <p> blue light over the Bois de Boulogne it continues</p>
      <p> the Seine continues</p>

      <p> and Irving Sandler continues to be the balayeur des artistes</p>
      <p> and so do I (sometimes I think I'm "in love" with painting)</p>
      <p> and surely the Piscine Deligny continues to have water in it</p>
      <p> and the Flore continues to have tables and newspapers</p>

      <p> where are you?</p>
      <p> here I am on the sidewalk under the moonlike lamplight thinking how precious moss is so unique and greenly crushable if you can find it on the north side of the tree where the fog binds you and then, tearing apart into soft white lies, spreads its disease through the primal night of an everlasting winter which nevertheless has heat in tubes, west-side and east-side and its intricate individual pathways of white accompanied by the ringing of telephone bells beside which someone sits in silence denying their own number, never given out! nameless like the sound of troika bells rushing past suffering in the first storm, it is snowing now, it is already too late the snow will go away, but nobody will be there</p>

      <p> of the theatre in Spain they said nothing for foreigners and we head in our lovely 1st class coach, shifting and sagging, towards the northwest, while in other compartments Dietrich and Erich von Stroheim share a sandwich of chorizos and a bottle of Vichy Catalan, in the dining car the travelling gentleman with linear mustache and many many rings rolls his cigar around and drinks Martini y ginebra, and Lillian Gish rolls on over the gorges with a tear in her left front eye, comme Picasso, through the night through the night, longitudinous and affected with stars; the riverbeds so far below look as a pig's tongue on a platter, and storms break over San Sebastian, 40 foot waves drench us pleasantly and we see a dead dog bloated as a fraise lolling beside the quai and slowly pulling out to sea</p>

      <p> for Isadora so perfectly</p>
      <p> she would never allow me to dance again</p>
      <p> that's the way it was in Bayreuth</p>

      <p> it was amusing to be lying all</p>

      <p> it was like exercise</p>
      <p> it means something to exercise</p>

      <p> nobody saw me because of the falls the gates the sluice the</p>
      <p> tourist boats the children were trailing their fingers in the water and the swans, regal and smarty, were nipping their "little"</p>
      <p> fingers I heard one swan remark "That was a good nip though they are not as interesting as sausages" and another reply "Nor as tasty as those peasants we got away from the</p>
      <p> elephant that time" but I didn't really care for conversation that day I wanted to be alone</p>
      <p> which is why I went to the mill in the first place now I am alone and hate it</p>

      <p> Behind New York there's a face and it's not Sibelius's with a cigar it was red it was strange and hateful and then I became a child again like a nadir or a zenith or a nudnik</p>

      <p> 73 FANTASY</p>
      <p> {dedicated to the health of Allen Ginsberg)</p>
      <p> How do you like the music of Adolph</p>
      <p> Deutsch? I like it, I like it better than Max Steiner's. Take his score for  Northern Pursuit,  the Helmut Dantyne theme was . . .</p>
      <p> and then the window fell on my hand. Errol Flynn was skiing by. Down</p>
      <p> down down went the grim grey submarine under the "cold" ice.</p>
      <p> Helmut was safely ashore, on the ice.</p>
      <p> What dreams, what incredible fantasies of snow farts will this all lead to?</p>
      <p> I don't know, I have stopped thinking like a sled dog.</p>
      <p> The main thing is to tell a story.</p>
      <p> It is almost very important. Imagine</p>
      <p> throwing away the avalanche so early in the movie. I am the only spy left in Canada,</p>
      <p> but just because I'm alone in the snow doesn't necessarily mean I'm a Nazi.</p>
      <p> Let's see, two aspirins a vitamin G tablet and some baking soda should do the trick, that's practically an</p>
      <p> Alka</p>
      <div class="newpage" id="page-74"/>
      <p> Seltzer. Allen come out of the bathroom</p>
      <p> and take it. I think someone put butter on my skis instead of wax.</p>
      <p> Ouch. The leanto is falling over in the firs, and there is another fatter spy here. They didn't tell me they sent</p>
      <p> him. Well, that takes care of him, boy were those huskies hungry.</p>
      <p> Allen, are you feeling any better? Yes, I'm crazy about Helmut Dantyne</p>
      <p> but I'm glad that Canada will remain free. Just free, that's all, never argue with the movies.</p>
