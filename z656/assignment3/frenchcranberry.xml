        <!-- Rice is included in the directions, but not the ingredient list. I considered including it here and commenting it out, but that would make non-computer readable. I decided to instead give this ingredient the attribute "hidden" to show that it would not be included in the printed ingredient list, but to hopefully make it still useful for Alexa as she attempts to prepare dinner (of course, any IOT device would probably want a qantity as well, and the steps below would likely need much more information to make them useful for a computer) -->
